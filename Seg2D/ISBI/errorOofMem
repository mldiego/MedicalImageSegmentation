Layer 48, before that it seems fine

What layers do we have? Can we change some Star variables to sparse and still make it work? Sparse only supports 2D, so no V possible, only C. Would this do it?
 - ImageInput        (fine)
 - Conv2D            (fine, it only cares about V, so we can keep C (the problem so far) as sparse)
 - Relu              (seems fine with C as sparse)
 - BatchNorm         (fine)
 - TransposedConv2D  (?)
 - Concatenation     (this should be fine with sparse)
 - Tanh              (this should be fine with sparse)

I can also get a "Box" overapprox if too many constraints are present to reduce memory, even if method may be a bit worse, but how much worse can it get? Not sure...
